# tailwind-react-boilerplate :snowflake:

This is a create-react-app and tailwind based boilerplate with both development and production scripts (minified CSS).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Importing tailwind.generated.css :rocket:

You only need to add this once in index.js:
`import "./tailwind.generated.css";`
As it has already been added to index.js and is accesible to all components.

## Available Scripts :penguin:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` :watch:

Runs the app in the development mode and watches for changes in tailwind classes.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` :briefcase:

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` :hammer:

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Tailwind css generated is minified.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
